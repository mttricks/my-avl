# my-avl
This is my implementation of AVL trees and several files of test cases. This was a project for my data structures class.

AVL trees are Binary Search Trees that self balance. This means that the difference of the height of all leaf nodes of any given node is always less than 2.
This elimnates the problem that occurs when inputing a sorted list into a BST.

The output files corresponding with each input file should match the key files.
The details file contains a side by side view of the expected output and actual output.
The turnin file is what was turned in for credit in the class, it is just the text from all the output files.
